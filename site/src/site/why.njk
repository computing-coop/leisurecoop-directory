title: Spaghetti Directory

<div class='container--s mt1 pt1'>
  <p>I wanted to make a web directory that put artists/creators first. Instead of elevating the final products exclusively. This site will showcase work of individuals and studios, with an aim to exposing all the real moving pieces of the puzzle.</p>
  <p>In general good websites are usually built by more then 1 person, and usually 3-10 people given the scope/size of the project. People showcased in here will include designers, coders, writers, photographers, editors, stylist and more.</p>
  <p>The initial offerring of creators/artists/websites is being generated from the slack spaghetti community. A small slack that exists in weird corners of the internet.</p>
