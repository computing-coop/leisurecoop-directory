  <p>Instead of elevating the final products exclusively, this web directory puts artists/creators first. This site will showcase work of individuals and studios, with the aim of exposing all the real moving pieces of the make-a-website puzzle.</p>
  <p>In general, good websites are usually built by more then 1 person, and more often by 3-10 people, given the scope/size of the project. People showcased here include designers, coders, writers, photographers, editors, stylists, and more.</p>
  <p>The initial offering of creators/artists/websites is being generated from the Spaghetti community: a small Slack that exists in weird corners of the internet.</p>
